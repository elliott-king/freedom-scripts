Moving in from Chicago, newcomer Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon) is in shock when he discovers the small Midwestern town he now calls home has made dancing and rock music illegal. As he struggles to fit in, Ren faces an uphill battle to change things. With the help of his new friend, Willard Hewitt (Christopher Penn), and defiant teen Ariel Moore (Lori Singer), he might loosen up this conservative town. But Arielâ€™s influential father, Reverend Shaw Moore (John Lithgow), stands in the way.

The movie screening will be preceded by a dance class by Margaret Batiuchok. Margaret (danceMB.com) teaches swing, ballroom, solo jazz and stretch in Manhattan and on Zoom. She holds a BFA (Cal Arts) and a MA in Dance (NYU). She is the founder and president of the NY Swing Dance Society, a Harvest Moon Ball Champion, and a Flushing local.

There will also be a bar serving alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, as well as a pre-screening craft activity!

ADVANCED TICKETS strongly recommended. Walk-ins welcome upon availability.""",
